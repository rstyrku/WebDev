# WebDev

This is some small projects that I had worked on when going through the following Udemy Course on my own time.
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/

The course was something I decided to go through on my personal time in order to get a start understanding how the Front End of an Application worked and how the Front End and Back End communicate with one another. 

All of the projects in this repository are code alongs that were a part of the Course.
